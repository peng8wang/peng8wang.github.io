== About Me
I am currently a postdoc research fellow advised by Professors [https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~girasole/ Laura Balzano] and [https://qingqu.engin.umich.edu/ Qing Qu] at [https://umich.edu/ University of Michigan]. Before that, I got my Ph.D. degree in Systems Engineering and Engineering Management advised by Professor [https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~manchoso/ Anthony Man-Cho So] at [https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ The Chinese University of Hong Kong].

== Research Interests 
My research interests mainly lie in non-convex optimization for low-complexity representation learning and their applications in machine learning, signal processing, and data science, such as subspace recovery, community detection, constriained PCA, and neural collapse. Currently, I am devoted to understanding mathematical insights into deep learning via low-complexity modeling and non-convex optimization. 

* Feel free to email me if you are interested in my research. Remote collaboration is also welcome!*
